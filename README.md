## Introduction:

**Comparing inhabitants of the multiverse!** A project for Rick and Morty fans using Tailwind CSS, React, TypeScript, and Next.js 14.

Are you a Rick and Morty fan who has ever wondered how your favorite characters compare? This project is for you! Using the Rick and Morty API, we will create a modern and efficient web application with Tailwind CSS, React, TypeScript, and Next.js 14. You'll be able to compare and contrast different characters based on various characteristics, as well as information related to the episodes they appear in.

## Features:

**Detailed Comparison:** Compare two characters at a time and learn about their names, status, species, and the episodes they appear in both collectively and individually.

**Front-end:**

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (for high-performance web application development)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (for rapid development of consistent and responsive interfaces)
- **Typing:** TypeScript (for increased code safety and reliability)
- **Testing:** Jest and React Testing Library (for React component unit and integration testing)
- **API Connection:** Fetch API or Axios (to interact with the Rick and Morty API)

## Getting Started

This project is built with Next.js 14 and requires Node.js 18.17.0 or later installed.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
